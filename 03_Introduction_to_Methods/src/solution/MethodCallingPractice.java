		// 'region' at the bottom of the class called "The hidden girls"
		// You don't need to look in this region to see what the methods are
		// called as we are going to tell you, well give you a clue anyway.

		// Each method is a common girls name, one starts with 'a', one with
		// 'b' etc up to letter 'g' so you should be able to find
		// them in the intellisense list easily, one of the 7 is overloaded.

		// We want you to call each in turn according to the following rules
		// (these are repeated down below, so you don't need to remember them)
		// If the method takes 1 parameter pass a literal value e.g(3) or
		// ("Jane")
		// If it takes 2 parameters pass a literal then a variable e.g(3,x)
		// If it takes 3 parameters pass a literal, a variable,
		// and an expression an example might be methodName(3, x, x + 3);

		// If the method is overloaded (Intellisense will show 2 versions)
		// then you must invoke each version according to the rules above
		// If the method is not void (1st word in the Intellisense box!)
		// then you simply MUST catch what is returned and DISPLAY it.
		// Final rule, you must call at least one of the methods passing
		// something 'narrower' than what is expected allowing a safe widening
		// conversion to happen.

		// Each method will display on the Console a String (a sentence)
		// which uses the parameters you passed to that method.

		// Here are some predefined but uninitialised variables to save you a
		// few seconds, ADD OTHERS if you want.

		// start calling 'alice', 'beatrice' etc running your code regularly
		// feel free to write any lines of code you need before each call

		// remember
		// 1st param - a literal
		// 2nd param - a variable
		// 3rd param an expression
		// catch and display any values returned
		// decide where the widening conversion happens
		// call both versions of the 1 method of the 7 that is overloaded
		// one method returns true/false, think of an appropriate display
